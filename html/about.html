            <p id="pwaw">We are a small business based in Cape Town but ship nation-wide. <br> We make custom jewellery,
                as well as sell a collection of classic bracelets which are also hand made. <br>
                Our goal is to make sure every customer receives a product that suits their needs

            <h3 id="os">Our story</h3>
            <p id="pos">During the harsh Covid-19 lockdown, I found myself crafting jewellery to keep me busy. <br>
               To my surprise, a lot of people loved the bracelets I made and wanted me to hand make bracelets
               for them, and even their friends and family. <br> From there on i began a small business from home,
               making and selling charm bracelets. My business became quite popular <br> and so I decided to expand
               and create a website whereby customers can order online and have their order shipped anywhere in South Africa!
